* Covid-19 Facts
** Definitions
- SARS-CoV-2
- COVID-19

  In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
** How dangerous is it?
- Early data from China: 3.4% case fatality rate
- Mathematical models have suggested that 40–81% of the world population could be infected, and have lowered the infection fatality rate to 1.0% or 0.9%
- The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations, depends on:
  - Population age structure
  - Medical treatments available
  - Health situation

** How dangerous is it? (continued)

    This paper was the FIRST in the world to demonstrate an 84% reduction in hospitalization and death if COVID-19 was treated early in the prehospital setting. These world class scientists did it for free for the sake of humanity. God should bless them for all eternity.

    Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.

  - Used POISONOUS and LETHAL doses of HCQ (2400mg/day).  Death rate was over 25% of participants.
  - Results—1,542 patients of these 396 patients (25.7%) who were in the high dose Hydroxychloroquine arm, died.

** How efficacy value is calculated
- Relative Risk reduction(What's been told)
[[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_212621_3uWJ9j.png]]
Keep in mind when you read this data, there is no reliable way to tell who really got COVID
- Absolute risk reduction
 [[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_212914_Qr7WBX.png]]

** Put data together
[[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_213117_gRIuqt.png]]

** Understand phases of clinical trails
- Phase I - Determine Safety. If you can’t find a safe dose, then it doesn’t matter if it works. Small in numbers & healthy people.
- Phase II (aka Exploratory Trials) - If a Safe Dose is Found - Does the Drug Work?
- Phase III - How does the drug compare with that already used for the problem?
- Phase IV - Post Marketing Surveillance Studies (aka Pharmacovigilance).

** How vaccine had been developped

  - "More harm of these mRNA vaccines will happen in the years to come"
  - "Any one who's over 70, who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably sadly die within about two to three years"
  - "And I would say anyone who gets the mRNA injection, no matter what age you are, your life expectancy will be reueced to you know, die if you're in your thirties within five to ten years."
