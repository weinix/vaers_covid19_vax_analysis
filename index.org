* Covid-19 Facts
- Definitions
- How dangerous is it
- Asymptiomatic Transimission
** Definitions
- SARS-CoV-2
  -  In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.
  -  The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
- COVID-19
  -  The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

** How dangerous is it?
- Early data from China: 3.4% case fatality rate
- Mathematical models have suggested that 40–81% of the world population could be infected, and have lowered the infection fatality rate to 1.0% or 0.9%
- The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations, depends on:
  - Population age structure
  - Medical treatments available
  - Health situation

** How dangerous is it? (continued)

** About Asymptomatic Transmission
[[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_191134_ckRtJR.png]]
- The theory of asymptomatic transmission is yet to be proven
- Only peer reviewed study

* How reliable are the metrics?
- Where are the Covid-19 case numbers come from?
- Why FDA has so many recalls on tests and not on media?
- More on PCR
- US monthly total death trend
- Double standards on Vaxed and Non-Vaxed!
** Where are Covid-19 case numbers come from?

  - "If you do it well, you can find amlost anything in anybody."
  - "If you can amplify one single molecule, up to something that you can really measure which PCR can do. Then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of them in your body."

* Vaccine Facts
- Traditional vaccines vs mRNA vaccines
- Understand vaccine efficacy
- Understand clinical trials
- Understand how vaccines are been developped
** Traditional vaccines

** How vaccine had been developped
[[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_214211_jELaLo.png]]
** Understand phases of clinical trails
- Phase I - Determine Safety. If you can’t find a safe dose, then it doesn’t matter if it works. Small in numbers & healthy people.
- Phase II (aka Exploratory Trials) - If a Safe Dose is Found - Does the Drug Work?
- Phase III - How does the drug compare with that already used for the problem?
- Phase IV - Post Marketing Surveillance Studies (aka Pharmacovigilance).

** How efficacy value is calculated
- Relative Risk reduction(What's been told)

  [[file:CovidVaxOverview.org_imgs/20211011_212621_3uWJ9j.png]]
  - Keep in mind there is no reliable way to tell who really got COVID
- Absolute risk reduction

  - "More harm of these mRNA vaccines will happen in the years to come"
  - "Any one who's over 70, who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably sadly die within about two to three years"
  - "And I would say anyone who gets the mRNA injection, no matter what age you are, your life expectancy will be reueced to you know, die if you're in your thirties within five to ten years."
