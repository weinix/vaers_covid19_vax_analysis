    "# VAERS Data Analysis\n",
    "## Important Information About VAERS\n",
    "* VAERS was created by FDA and CDC to receive reports about adverse events that may be associated with vaccenes. (Nov. 1, 1990 to today)\n",
    "* VAERS is used to continually monitor reports to determine whether any vaccine or vaccine lot has a higher than expected rate of events.\n",
    "* About 85-90% of vaccine adverse event reports concern relatively minor events, such as fevers or redness and swelling at the injection site. The remaining reports(less than 15%) describe serious events, such as hospitalizations, life-threatening illnesses, or deaths. \n",
    "* The adverse events described in each report were coded utilizing the FDA's Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) from November 1990 until 1/16/2007\n",
    "* On 1/17/2007 the VAERS coding system was converted to an international coding system that is used worldwide. This system is called the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\n",
    "* There are two VAERS form, both versions are currently accepted:\n",
    " * VAERS 1 (before July 2017)\n",
    " * VAERS 2 (after July 2017)\n",
    "* When multiple reports of a silgle case or event are received, only the first report received is included in the publicly acessible dataset.... \n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of Data Files\n",
    "* Data sets files can be downloaded from [here](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html)\n",
    "* There are three data files:\n",
    " * VAERSDATA.CSV\n",
    " * VAERSVAX.CSV\n",
    " * VAERSSYMPTOMS.CSV\n",
    "* There are three data types:\n",
    " * NUM = numeric data\n",
    " * CHAR = text or \"character\" data\n",
    " * DATE = date fields in mm/dd/yy format\n",
    " \n",
    "## VAERS Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "* VAERS is a passive reporting system, meaning that reports about adverse events are not automatically collected, but require a report to be filed to VAERS. VAERS reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members. Reports vary in quality and completeness. They often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.\n",
    "* \"Underreporting\" is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS. The term, underreporting refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events. The degree of underreporting varies widely. As an example, a great many of the millions of vaccinations administered each year by injection cause soreness, but relatively few of these episodes lead to a VAERS report. Physicians and patients understand that minor side effects of vaccinations often include this kind of discomfort, as well as low fevers. On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.\n",
    "* A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## STATE column are for the home state of the vaccinee. Foreign reports are in a separate data file(Non-Domestic)\n",
    " * STATE include all states and US territories like Puto Rico(PR), Guam(GU), etc.\n",
    " * The scope of this analysis is Domestic reports ONLY!\n",
    "\n",

Patient tested negative for SARSCOV2 on admission on 3/9. She was deemed a candidate for the vaccine and it was administered on 3/10 (Janssen Lot 1805031).  On 3/19, she tested positive for SARSCOV2. She developed worsening respiratory failure and required oxygen supplementation with gradual escalation until she was intubated on 3/29. She received 5 days of remdesivir and steroid therapy. She developed DIC for which she received supportive care (vitamin K, transfusions, etc) and an HLH-type picture for which the steroids treatment was prolonged. She was not a candidate for tocilizumab given the elevated LFTs &gt; 5x the upper limit of normal. During the ICU course patient was started on hemodialysis. Patient gradually started improving around 4/5 with planning for spontaneous breathing trials in attempts to extubate after weaning of sedatives. On 4/8, during a dialysis session patient became hypotensive and bradycardic. After this episode, patient's mental status worsened and developed worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening shock refractory to vasopressors. Family decided for DNR and transition to comfort care.

       "235225  53 y.o. female with a PMhx of asthma, CHF, CKD (not on HD), DM, HTN, hypothyroidism, methadone dependence for back pain, chronic bilateral foot ulcers presents with c/o one day of fever and admitted for sepsis of unknown origin on 3/9. Patient tested negative for SARSCOV2 on admission on 3/9. She was deemed a candidate for the vaccine and it was administered on 3/10 (Janssen Lot 1805031).  On 3/19, she tested positive for SARSCOV2. She developed worsening respiratory failure and required oxygen supplementation with gradual escalation until she was intubated on 3/29. She received 5 days of remdesivir and steroid therapy. She developed DIC for which she received supportive care (vitamin K, transfusions, etc) and an HLH-type picture for which the steroids treatment was prolonged. She was not a candidate for tocilizumab given the elevated LFTs > 5x the upper limit of normal. During the ICU course patient was started on hemodialysis. Patient gradually started improving around 4/5 with planning for spontaneous breathing trials in attempts to extubate after weaning of sedatives. On 4/8, during a dialysis session patient became hypotensive and bradycardic. After this episode, patient's mental status worsened and developed worsening metabolic acidosis and worsening shock refractory to vasopressors. Family decided for DNR and transition to comfort care. Patient expired on 4/12.  \n",

Co-suspect products included Flu unspecified (Flu vaccine) for prophylaxis.   On an unknown date, the patient received Flu vaccine at an unknown dose and Flu vaccine at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Flu vaccine and not applicable after receiving Flu vaccine, the patient experienced erythema multiforme (serious criteria GSK medically significant), erythema multiforme (serious criteria GSK medically significant), papular rash and papular rash. Rechallenge with Flu vaccine was positive. On an unknown date, the outcome of the erythema multiforme and papular rash were recovered/resolved and the outcome of the erythema multiforme and papular rash were unknown.   The reporter considered the erythema multiforme and papular rash to be related to Flu vaccine. The reporter considered the erythema multiforme and papular rash to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of erythema multiforme (EM) in a female patient aged 2-year-old who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to result section reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of study that aimed to describe reported Erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (EM/SJS/TEN) after vaccines during 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through April 27, 2018). Country reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) were identified and compared the relative frequency of EM/SJS/TEN reported to VAERS by vaccine, to better understand if there were any concerning patterns of reported EM/SJS/TEN (e.g., after a specific vaccine, or among a particular age group) or other emerging safety concerns. [In this study, it was reported AEs occurring after vaccination can be reported to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system established in 1990 to monitor AEs that is jointly administered by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]. No information on patient's medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was noted with EM. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through 27th April 2018), the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (received as of 27th April 2018), an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was again noted with EM. [In this study, the resulting reports for reports of EM/SJS/TEN that were diagnosed by physicians (reported by a physician, or a physician's diagnosis was documented in available medical records) were received. For reports of symptoms consistent with EM/SJS/TEN, but without a physician's diagnosis, we defined EM as papular lesions, classically with a ringed (targetoid\") appearance, usually beginning peripherally and then spreading to the torso, that could involve the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, without mucosal lesions. Most reports of EM/SJS/TEN described onset of symptoms within 14 days of vaccination] Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was not reported. The authors commented, \"Of the 4 persons we describe who previously experienced EM or SJS after vaccination, two experienced another episode of EM or SJS after the same vaccine (positive rechallenge). Our estimated reporting rates of EM/SJS/TEN after varicella and influenza vaccines were well below this figure (i.e., the highest estimate was 1.0 report of EM per million doses of varicella vaccine distributed), a notable observation considering that varicella vaccine was one of the most commonly reported vaccines after which EM/SJS/TEN occurred. Despite potentially underestimating rates, our data suggest that EM/SJS/TEN is reported no more frequently after vaccination than after known causes of these conditions. Importantly, while EM/SJS/TEN can occur after vaccination, previous post-marketing analyses and case-control studies demonstrate that vaccination itself does not increase the likelihood of these conditions\". The authors concluded \"EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine\".

       "62  Erythema multiforme; Erythema multiforme; papular lesions; papular lesions; This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of erythema multiforme in a 2-year-old female patient who received Flu unspecified (Flu vaccine) for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Flu unspecified (Flu vaccine) for prophylaxis.   On an unknown date, the patient received Flu vaccine at an unknown dose and Flu vaccine at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Flu vaccine and not applicable after receiving Flu vaccine, the patient experienced erythema multiforme (serious criteria GSK medically significant), erythema multiforme (serious criteria GSK medically significant), papular rash and papular rash. Rechallenge with Flu vaccine was positive. On an unknown date, the outcome of the erythema multiforme and papular rash were recovered/resolved and the outcome of the erythema multiforme and papular rash were unknown.   The reporter considered the erythema multiforme and papular rash to be related to Flu vaccine. The reporter considered the erythema multiforme and papular rash to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of erythema multiforme (EM) in a female patient aged 2-year-old who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to result section reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of study that aimed to describe reported Erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (EM/SJS/TEN) after vaccines during 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through April 27, 2018). Country reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) were identified and compared the relative frequency of EM/SJS/TEN reported to VAERS by vaccine, to better understand if there were any concerning patterns of reported EM/SJS/TEN (e.g., after a specific vaccine, or among a particular age group) or other emerging safety concerns. [In this study, it was reported AEs occurring after vaccination can be reported to VAERS, a national spontaneous reporting system established in 1990 to monitor AEs that is jointly administered by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]. No information on patient's medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided.  On an unspecified date, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was noted with EM. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (among reports received by CDC and FDA through 27th April 2018), the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date between 1st October 1999 through 31st December 2017 (received as of 27th April 2018), an unknown period after vaccination, the patient was again noted with EM. [In this study, the resulting reports for reports of EM/SJS/TEN that were diagnosed by physicians (reported by a physician, or a physician's diagnosis was documented in available medical records) were received. For reports of symptoms consistent with EM/SJS/TEN, but without a physician's diagnosis, we defined EM as papular lesions, classically with a ringed (targetoid\") appearance, usually beginning peripherally and then spreading to the torso, that could involve the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, without mucosal lesions. Most reports of EM/SJS/TEN described onset of symptoms within 14 days of vaccination] Treatment was unknown. Outcome of the event was not reported. The authors commented, \"Of the 4 persons we describe who previously experienced EM or SJS after vaccination, two experienced another episode of EM or SJS after the same vaccine (positive rechallenge). Our estimated reporting rates of EM/SJS/TEN after varicella and influenza vaccines were well below this figure (i.e., the highest estimate was 1.0 report of EM per million doses of varicella vaccine distributed), a notable observation considering that varicella vaccine was one of the most commonly reported vaccines after which EM/SJS/TEN occurred. Despite potentially underestimating rates, our data suggest that EM/SJS/TEN is reported no more frequently after vaccination than after known causes of these conditions. Importantly, while EM/SJS/TEN can occur after vaccination, previous post-marketing analyses and case-control studies demonstrate that vaccination itself does not increase the likelihood of these conditions\". The authors concluded \"EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine\". This is 1 of the 6 valid cases reported in the same literature article.   \n",

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI &gt; or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI &gt; 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     &lt; 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.  The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.  Where deemed necessary, refer to Pharmacy for assistance or more    information.   ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 0756 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: B 200116 KBC 370                    CK. . . . . . . . .   17386       H           (39-308)       U/L Result Comment:  Results verified by dilution  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: B 200115 KBH 160                    WBC . . . . . . . . . .   6.7                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   5.18               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  15.1               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  43.1               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  83.2                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  29.2                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  35.0               (32.0-36.0)      g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.3               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   197                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   8.8     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  76.0     H         (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  13.2     L           (20-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  10.1     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   0.3                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.3                  (0-3.0)       %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   5.10               (1.5-7.5)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   0.9     L          (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.7                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.02                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: B 200115 KBC 346                    CK. . . . . . . . .   10559       H           (39-308)       U/L Result Comment:  (RVD)  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                  URINE Ordered Panel Test: UA Performing Lab: B 200115 KBU 159                    COLOR . . . . . . . . .

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.  The value has    been derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration    Equation.  Values for African Americans must be adjusted as follows:    (eGFR)*(1.159).  As with all estimations, results may not be valid for    certain sub-groups including: pediatric patients (0-17 years old), severely    hypoalbuminemic patients, patients not in steady state (including acute    renal failure), dialysis patients, and patients with atypical body habitus.         Some pharmacological therapeutics are dosed based on older versions of the    eGFR.  Where deemed necessary, refer to Pharmacy for assistance or more    information.   ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 0756 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: B 200116 KBC 370                    CK. . . . . . . . .   17386       H           (39-308)       U/L Result Comment:  Results verified by dilution  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: B 200115 KBH 160                    WBC . . . . . . . . . .   6.7                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   5.18               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  15.1               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  43.1               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  83.2                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  29.2                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  35.0               (32.0-36.0)      g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.3               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   197                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   8.8     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  76.0     H         (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  13.2     L           (20-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  10.1     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   0.3                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.3                  (0-3.0)       %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   5.10               (1.5-7.5)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   0.9     L          (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.7                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.02                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: B 200115 KBC 346                    CK. . . . . . . . .   10559       H           (39-308)       U/L Result Comment:  (RVD)  15 Jan 20 @ 1005 (Coll)                                                  URINE Ordered Panel Test: UA Performing Lab: B 200115 KBU 159                    COLOR . . . . . . . . .

Serial draws are recommended per ACC/AHA guidelines.         Any condition resulting in myocardial cell damage can increase cardiac    troponin levels such as angina, CHF, myocarditis, cardiac surgery, or    invasive testing and non-specific cardiac related causes such as PE, renal    failure, and sepsis.        cTnI > or = 0.034 ng/mL may be diagnostic of MI when used in conjunction with   appropriate signs/symptoms and/or troponin changes.       Up to 30% of renal failure patients on dialysis have cTnI > 0.04 ng/mL using   this assay. Increased levels in renal failure patients may signify underlying   cardiac damage.  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  BLOOD Ordered Panel Test: CBC Performing Lab: A 200116 RH 3468               STAT WBC . . . . . . . . . .   5.5                (3.9-10.6)      X10(9)/L      RBC CNT . . . . . . . .   4.87               (4.5-5.9)       X10(12)/L      HGB . . . . . . . . . .  14.0               (13.3-17.7)      g/dL      HCT . . . . . . . . . .  41.6               (40.0-53.1)      %      MCV . . . . . . . . . .  85.4                 (80-100)       fL      MCH . . . . . . . . . .  28.7                 (25-34)        pg      MCHC. . . . . . . . . .  33.7                 (32-36)        g/dL      RDW . . . . . . . . . .  12.7               (11.5-14.5)      %      PLATELETS . . . . . .   179                  (150-440)       X10(9)/L      MPV . . . . . . . . . .   9.2     L          (9.4-12.4)      fL      GRANULO/100 . . . . . .  55.8               (42.2-75.2)      %      LYMPH/100 WBC . . . . .  25.8                 (22-44)        %      MONO/100 WBC. . . . . .  14.7     H            (0-10)        %      EOS/100 WBC . . . . . .   3.1                  (0-5)         %      BASO/100 WBC. . . . . .   0.4                  (0-3)         %      NEUT# . . . . . . . . .   3.05               (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      LYMPH#. . . . . . . . .   1.4                (1.0-4.8)       X10(9)/L      MONO# . . . . . . . . .   0.8                  (0-0.8)       X10(9)/L      EOS#. . . . . . . . . .   0.17                 (0-.45)       X10(9)/L      BASO# . . . . . . . . .   0.0                  (0-.20)       X10(9)/L  ===============================================================================     L=Lo  H=Hi  *=Critical   R=Resist  S=Susc  MS=Mod Susc  I=Intermed   []=Uncert  /A=Amended  Comments= (O)rder, (I)nterpretations, (R)esult =============================================================================== ? 16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                 PLASMA Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218121             STAT CK. . . . . . . . .   20294       H           (30-225)       Units/L  16 Jan 20 @ 1437 (Coll)                                                  SERUM Ordered Panel Test: COMP METABOLIC Performing Lab: A 200116 CL 218122             STAT GLUCOSE . . . . . . . .  97                   (70-105)       mg/dL      BUN . . . . . . . . . .  14                    (7-23)        mg/dL      CREAT . . . . . . . . .   0.79               (.57-1.25)      mg/dL      NA+ . . . . . . . . .   141                  (136-145)       mmol/L      K . . . . . . . . . . .   4.1                (3.7-5.3)       mmol/L      CL- . . . . . . . . .   107                   (98-107)       mmol/L      HCO3. . . . . . . . . .  25                   (22-29)        mmol/L      CA. . . . . . . . . . .   9.2                (8.4-10.2)      mg/dL      PROTEIN TOTAL . . . . .   6.9                (6.4-8.3)       g/dL      ALBUMIN . . . . . . . .   4.4                (3.5-5.0)       g/dL      AST . . . . . . . . .   370       H            (5-34)        Units/L      ALT . . . . . . . . .   101       H           (10-55)        Units/L      ALK PHOS. . . . . . . .  56                   (54-369)       Units/L      TBILI . . . . . . . . .   0.4                (0.2-1.2)       mg/dL      ANION GAP . . . . . . .   9                    (8-16)        mmol/L      GFR-NAA . . . . . . .   131.1                                mL/min      GFR-AA. . . . . . . .   151.5                                mL/min Interpretations:     >= 60 mL/min/1.73m2 = Normal or mildly decreased GFR      30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 = Moderately decreased GFR     15-29 mL/min/1.73m2 = Severely decreased GFR     < 15  mL/min/1.73m2 = Kidney failure                               This is an estimated GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) only.
